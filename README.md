# CompareImages-OpenCV

Opens two images and compares them taking into account relative shift between them.
Use several track-bars to dynamically select regions of interest, template regions (to find better match),
thresholds, minimum detectable defect area etc.

Uses OpenCV functions: matchTemplate, absDifference, threshold, findContours.
